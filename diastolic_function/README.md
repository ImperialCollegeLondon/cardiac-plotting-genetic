# Genetic and environmental determinants of diastolic heart function

> Abstract

Left ventricular diastolic function is a key determinant of ventricular pressures and stroke volume, and abnormal diastolic function is related to many cardiovascular disease processes and is associated with poorer outcomes. The genetic architecture of diastolic function is largely unknown and so we investigated this in a genome wide association study of cardiac motion phenotypes in 39,000 subjects from UK Biobank. We identified xx significant loci containing genes associated with... Network analyses revealed the relationship between diastolic function and multiple cardiovascular and environmental risk factors. Our results provide insights into the genetic and environmental architecture of diastolic function that are relevant to cardiovascular disease and ageing.
